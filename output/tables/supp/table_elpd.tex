\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:elpd}Model comparison based on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO).  MVN denotes a multivariate normal distribution, while Student-t $+$ MVN specifies a univariate Student-t distribution for each response combined with multivariate normal random effects.
  The expected log predictive density (ELPD) reflects out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with higher values indicating better performance. ELPD differences are shown relative to the best-fitting model, so negative values indicate worse fit. The standard error (SE) of the difference reflects uncertainty; differences large relative to SE suggest meaningful performance gaps.}
