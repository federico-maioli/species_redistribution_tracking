  The expected log predictive density (ELPD) reflects out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with higher values indicating better performance. ELPD differences are shown relative to the best-fitting model, so negative values indicate worse fit. The standard error (SE) of the difference reflects uncertainty; differences large relative to SE suggest meaningful performance gaps.}
