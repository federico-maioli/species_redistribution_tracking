\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
The world’s oceans are warming rapidly, driving a major reorganization of marine biodiversity \citep{ipcc_ocean_2022}. Many species respond by tracking their thermal niches---the temperature ranges suitable for survival and reproduction \citep{grinnell_niche-relationships_1917}---shifting their geographic distributions accordingly \citep{tingley_birds_2009}. These redistributions are reshaping marine ecosystems, altering food webs, challenging resource management, and redefining conservation priorities worldwide \citep{pinsky_preparing_2018, palacios-abrantes_climate_2025, pecl_biodiversity_2017}. Widespread poleward and deepward movements have been documented across taxa and regions, suggesting one of the most pervasive biological responses to climate change \citep{parmesan_globally_2003, parmesan_ecological_2006, poloczanska_global_2013, poloczanska_responses_2016}. Yet, many populations fail to follow these expectations, remaining stationary or even moving in unexpected directions \citep{rubenstein_climate_2023, fuchs_wrong-way_2020, lawlor_mechanisms_2024}, in part due to the complex mosaics of climate velocities across the ocean \citep{burrows_pace_2011, pinsky_marine_2013}. 

Despite extensive documentation of range shifts, most studies track redistributions along a single environmental gradient at a time---typically latitude, and less often depth \citep{lenoir_climate-related_2015}. This one-dimensional view oversimplifies species’ responses to ocean warming and may help explain why predictions of range shifts---both in magnitude and direction---often fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}. Consequently, our ability to anticipate future changes in species distributions and to manage their consequences remains limited. In reality, marine species are unlikely to respond to warming along one gradient alone. They may shift horizontally, move vertically into cooler waters, remain in place while tolerating greater thermal exposure, or combine these strategies \citep{nye_changing_2009}. Thus, considering shifts along multiple gradients and their potential interactions offers a more realistic representation of climate-driven redistribution of marine species \cite{lenoir_climate-related_2015}. However, no study has yet assessed how species respond simultaneously across horizontal, vertical, and thermal dimensions at broad spatial scales. 


To that end, we here develop and apply a multidimensional framework that considers three complementary dimensions of climate response: (i) horizontal range shifts, captured through changes in range centroids; (ii) vertical redistributions, reflected in realized depth niches; and
(iii) changes in realized thermal niches. This framework allows us to evaluate not only the direction and magnitude of spatial movements, but also whether such movements effectively track shifting thermal environments. If populations perfectly follow changing isotherms, their realized thermal niches should remain stable despite warming; systematic trends in niche temperature would instead indicate incomplete tracking and rising thermal exposure. Our study draws on a comprehensive set of standardized scientific bottom-trawl surveys, including more than 200 well sampled demersal (bottom-living) fish populations across 11 regions of the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. These regions include some of the fastest-warming continental shelf seas \citep{pershing_slow_2015, song_arctic_2023}, span broad latitudinal and climatic gradients, and contain some of the most comprehensive long-term records of marine biodiversity change (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}; \citep{maureaud_are_2021, maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}). Together, these contrasts in climate exposure and exceptional data coverage make these regions a natural laboratory for understanding how marine species respond to ocean warming across multiple gradients. We use spatiotemporal and Bayesian mixed-effects models to estimate annual species’ range centroids, depth distributions, and realized thermal niches, and to quantify long-term trends in these dimensions. By examining these patterns both within and across regions, we identify common strategies of climate response and evaluate the extent to which such movements reduce thermal exposure.

%Finally, we test whether these strategies are associated with changes in population abundance, potentially distinguishing species that are adapting to warming conditions from those in decline.

%% from here
%Here, we develop a multidimensional framework to quantify spatial redistribution of marine species, capturing changes across both horizontal and vertical axes. By integrating these components, we aim to identify consistent patterns of thermal tracking, evaluate departures from expectation, and provide a more comprehensive view of how marine biodiversity is reorganizing in response to ocean warming.

%These regions include some of the fastest-warming continental shelf seas \citep{pershing_slow_2015, song_arctic_2023}, span broad latitudinal and climatic gradients, and provide some of the world's most comprehensive long-term records of marine biodiversity change \citep{maureaud_are_2021, maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}. 
%Finally, to understand whether redistribution effectively buffers species from climate impacts, we link spatial and thermal adjustments to long-term abundance trends, testing whether movement strategies confer demographic resilience under ocean warming.
%However, movement alone does not ensure persistence—species may shift yet continue to face warming, or remain stationary while maintaining stable populations. To determine whether redistribution effectively buffers species from climate impacts, we link spatial and thermal adjustments to long-term abundance trends, testing whether movement strategies confer demographic resilience under ocean warming.


%Continental shelfs sustain exceptional biodiversity and productivity, support some of the world’s largest fisheries, and contribute roughly X\% of the global marine catch \citep{watson_database_2017}. Shelf systems also experience warming at rates exceeding the global ocean average , exposing resident species to accelerated thermal stress. Thus, continental shelves support high biodiversity and productivity while facing disproportionate exposure to climate-driven warming.

 
 %However, despite extensive evidence of redistribution, we still lack a clear understanding of how horizontal shifts, vertical movements, and changes in realized thermal niches jointly shape species’ climate responses. Because species experience warming in three dimensions, focusing on a single axis of movement can obscure whether populations are actually keeping pace with climate change.


%or We hypothesize that if populations perfectly track shifting temperatures, their realized thermal niches should remain stable through time despite environmental warming.

%By linking these spatial and thermal responses to long-term abundance trends, we test whether movement can buffer populations and sustain demographic resilience under climate change.

%Embracing this multidimensional perspective marks an essential step toward improving our ability to monitor, model, and manage species on the move.



%However,  Considering shifts in multiple directions and their potential interactions offers a more realistic representation of climate-driven redistribution of marine fishes. If populations perfectly track temperature, their niche should remain stable over time despite enviornmetnal warmig. In contrast, tredns in termal nich temperature would signal incomplete tracking. 


%Critically, these two missing pieces—considering multidimensional redistribution and linking shifts to demographic outcomes—are essential for understanding how populations cope with warming and whether movements effectively buffer species from thermal stress. 


%A further uncertainty is whether these redistributions actually mitigate thermal stress or translate into demographic benefits. Movement alone does not guarantee persistence under climate change—species may shift yet still experience warming, or remain stationary while maintaining stable populations. Understanding how spatial and thermal adjustments interact, and whether they confer resilience or risk, requires a multidimensional perspective that links redistribution to exposure and abundance outcomes.

 % this is also nice
%Despite the ubiquity of observed shifts, predictions of their direction and magnitude frequently fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}. One key reason is that most studies track redistribution along a single gradient—typically latitude, or less commonly, depth \citep{pinsky_marine_2013, dulvy_climate_2008}. This unidimensional focus overlooks how species respond simultaneously along multiple, interacting axes. In reality, marine populations can shift horizontally, redistribute vertically into cooler waters, or remain in place while tolerating increased thermal exposure \citep{nye_changing_2009}. Such multidimensional responses complicate how we interpret redistribution and may help explain persistent model mismatches between predicted and observed shifts.

%Evaluating these multidimensional responses together is essential to understand not only how species redistribute, but whether such movements effectively buffer populations from demographic decline.


%Our analysis combines these redistribution metrics with long-term trends in population abundance, providing a rare opportunity to link spatial and demographic responses to climate change. Drawing on standardized bottom-trawl surveys for more than 200 demersal fish populations across 11 continental shelf regions of the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific—among the fastest-warming marine ecosystems globally—we use spatiotemporal and Bayesian mixed-effects models to quantify shifts in range, depth, and temperature niches. We then identify whether distinct combinations of responses form coherent redistribution strategies and evaluate whether these strategies are associated with population growth or decline, thereby testing whether movement confers demographic resilience under ocean warming.

%Species are on the move in response to rapidly warming oceans, with many expected to shift poleward or into deeper waters to track their thermal niches—the ranges of temperatures suitable for survival and reproduction \citep{grinnell_niche-relationships_1917, poloczanska_global_2013}. Yet predictions of the direction and magnitude of these shifts often fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}, limiting our ability to anticipate changes in species distributions and to design effective management and conservation strategies. One key reason for this shortfall is that most studies examine redistribution along a single axis, such as latitude or depth \citep{pinsky_marine_2013, dulvy_climate_2008}. In reality, marine species can respond along multiple dimensions simultaneously: . Critically, understanding both the multidimensional nature of redistribution and whether such movements confer demographic benefits is essential for assessing how species cope with ocean warming.

\subsection{No net spatial shifts, but consistent niche warming}

Overall, we detected no consistent directional shifts in either latitude or longitude across species and regions, as 95\% credible intervals (CIs) greatly overlapped zero (Fig. \ref{fig:posterior_slopes}a). The posterior median global slope ($\beta_{\text{decade}}$) for latitudinal change was \LatMedian{} km~decade$^{-1}$ \LatCI{}, and for longitudinal change \LonMedian{} km~decade$^{-1}$ \LonCI{}. Depth exhibited a slightly stronger, though still uncertain, tendency toward deepening (\DepthMedian{} m~decade$^{-1}$ \DepthCI{}), while thermal niche temperatures increased consistently across species and regions (\ThermalMedian{} $^\circ$C~decade$^{-1}$ \ThermalCI{}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Coherent spatial shifts in some regions and region-specific niche warming}

\input{output/values/bayesian_trend_analysis/region_slopes}

At the regional scale, posterior slopes for spatial shifts varied in direction but were generally small and uncertain, offering limited evidence for consistent changes in mean latitude, longitude, or depth across species (Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_slopes}b). Depth showed the clearest—though still weak and variable—signals, with modest deepening along the U.S. West Coast (USWC; \DepthUSWCMedian{}~m~decade$^{-1}$ \DepthUSWCCI{}) and the Northeast U.S. \& Scotian Shelf (NEUS–SS; \DepthNEUSMedian{}~m~decade$^{-1}$ \DepthNEUSCI{}). Although regional slopes were weak, many species within some regions shifted in the same direction (Fig.~\ref{fig:prop_significant_supp}). In the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), 64\% of species moved northward, and a similar proportion did so in the North Sea (NS; 60\%), whereas six of eight species in the Baltic Sea (BAL) shifted southward. Depth shifts were also directionally consistent within some regions with many species deepening in the NEUS–SS (39\%) and BC (34\%), while few moved shallower. Some regions showed no detectable shifts—for example, no species in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) shifted in latitude, longitude, or depth, and depth did not change in the Northern Iberian Coast (NIC). Thermal-niche temperatures increased in nearly all regions and closely tracked local ocean-warming rates (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}; \textit{$\rho$} = 0.79, \textit{n} = 11, \textit{p} = 0.0036). The only regions without widespread thermal-niche warming were the EBS, Barents Sea (BS), and NIC.


\subsection{Species show heterogeneous spatial shifts but niche warming is widespread}

\input{output/values/bayesian_trend_analysis/prop_signif}
\input{output/values/bayesian_trend_analysis/prop_signif_by_dir}

At the species level, spatial shifts were highly variable in both direction and magnitude (Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_slopes}c). About \LatPerc{} of the 226 populations shifted in latitude, with northward and southward movements occurring in similar proportions. The most extreme northward shift was seen in \MaxLatSpecies{} in \MaxLatRegion{} (\MaxLatMedian{}~km~decade$^{-1}$ \MaxLatCI{}), and the largest southward in \MinLatSpecies{}~km~decade$^{-1}$ in \MinLatRegion{} (\MinLatMedian{} \MinLatCI{}). Longitudinal shifts occurred in 40\% of species, with \LonWestingPerc{} moving westward and \LonEastingPerc{} eastward; the strongest eastward and westward shifts were \MaxLonSpecies{} in \MaxLonRegion{} (\MaxLonMedian{}~km~decade$^{-1}$ \MaxLonCI{}) and \MinLonSpecies{} in \MinLonRegion{} (\MinLonMedian{}~km~decade$^{-1}$ \MinLonCI{}), respectively. Depth shifts were less frequent, with \DepthDeepeningPerc{} of species moving deeper and \DepthShallowingPerc{} shallower. The strongest deepening occurred in \MaxDepthSpecies{} in \MaxDepthRegion{} (\MaxDepthMedian{}~m~decade$^{-1}$ \MaxDepthCI{}), and the greatest shallowing in \MinDepthSpecies{} in \MinDepthRegion{} (\MinDepthMedian{}~m~decade$^{-1}$  \MinDepthCI{}). 
In contrast, most species experienced warming in their thermal niches (\ThermalPerc{}), led by \MaxThermalSpecies{} in \MaxThermalRegion{} (\MaxThermalMedian{}~$^\circ$C~decade$^{-1}$ \MaxThermalCI{}), and only three species showing signs of cooling.


\subsection{Species poorly track climate velocities}

Overall, species did not consistently track either the magnitude or the direction of their predicted thermal envelope shifts. Correlations between observed and expected shifts were generally weak, and only about half of the species exhibited alignment in shift direction (Supplementary Table \ref{tab:thermal_envelope}). This pattern was consistent across all regions, with no significant positive correlations observed between expected and actual shifts (Supplementary Table \ref{tab:thermal_envelope_regions}). However, some regions showed higher directional agreement: for example, 79\% of species in the EBS and 69\% in the BS displayed matching latitudinal shift directions between observed and expected values (Supplementary Table \ref{tab:thermal_envelope_regions}).

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Data sources}

\textbf{Fish observations.} We compiled fish biomass densities data (kg km\textsuperscript{-2}) from 
a large-scale collection of standardized, fishery-independent bottom-trawl surveys \citep{maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}. Each trawl deployment (haul) recorded the catch by species, with biomass standardized by the sampled (``swept'') area, alongside the haul’s location, depth, and time. We selected surveys with a consistent sampling protocol and at least 15 years of coverage, resulting in 17 surveys across 11 regions in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific (Fig \ref{fig:map}).
To ensure robust estimates of species’ spatial and temporal dynamics, we kept only taxa that (i) made up 99\% of the cumulative regional biomass, (ii) occurred in at least 15\% of hauls in that region, and (iii) were sampled in at least two hauls per year. These criteria yielded 237 fish populations (species–region combinations) across all regions (FIG S).

\textbf{Environmental data.} We obtained bottom temperature data from the Copernicus Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis \citep{european_union-copernicus_marine_service_global_2018}, which provides monthly estimates at 1/12$^{\circ}$ ($\approx$7 km) resolution. While in situ measurements exist for some surveys in certain years, we used this modeled product to obtain temporally averaged and spatially consistent time series. Bathymetric data were derived from the GEBCO 2023 dataset \citep{gebco_bathymetric_compilation_group_2023_gebco_2023_2023}, which provides global seafloor depth at 0.00417° ($\approx$400 m) resolution.



\subsection{Spatiotemporal modeling}\label{sec:Species spatiotemporal modeling}

\textbf{Model structure.} We modeled species distributions and their temporal dynamics using spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), a flexible approach widely used in fisheries science \citep{thorson_geostatistical_2015, thorson_model-based_2016}. For each species (S1 Table), biomass density was modeled with a Tweedie distribution, using year (as a factor) and log-transformed depth (modeled as a second-order polynomial) as predictors. Survey identity and quarter were included as fixed effects to account for differences in sampling and seasonal variation when appropriate. Spatial and spatiotemporal variation was captured through random fields, approximated via the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) method with Gaussian Markov random fields \citep{lindgren_explicit_2011}. Models were implemented in R with the \texttt{sdmTMB} package \citep{anderson_sdmtmb_2024}, which integrates finite-element meshes constructed with \texttt{fmesher} \citep{lindgren_fmesher_2025} into Template Model Builder (TMB) \citep{kristensen_tmb_2016}. Full details on model structure, parameterization, and fitting procedures are provided in Appendix \ref{Appendix A}.




\textbf{Prediction grid and environmental matching.} 
After model fitting and validation we predicted species-specific densities on a 4 × 4 km spatial
grid (in local UTM coordinates) covering each region for all years with available data. For each grid cell, we assigned bathymetry and the average bottom temperature over the 12 months preceding the earliest survey month in a region. This procedure generated a consistent spatiotemporal dataset of predicted biomass, depth, and temperature for downstream analyses.

\textbf{Derivation of multi-dimensional distributional metrics and abundance.} To assess species responses to ocean warming, we computed annual metrics that characterize both spatial redistribution and thermal exposure, specifically range centroids (UTM northing and easting), realized depth niche, and realized thermal niche. Horizontal shifts in distribution were quantified using range centroids rather than range edges, as centroids are less susceptible to noise and provide a clearer signal of overall distributional movement, thus offering a more stable and representative measure of geographic displacement \citep{shoo_detecting_2006}. Range centroids were calculated as the biomass-weighted mean UTM northing and easting (center of gravity) across grid cells. The realized depth and thermal niches were computed as biomass-weighted averages of depth and bottom temperature, respectively, summarizing the environmental conditions most intensely occupied by each species (Table~\ref{table:derived_quantities}). All these metrics were derived from biomass density predictions across the spatial grid generated by the fitted spatiotemporal models.

To estimate the annual abundance of each fish population, we calculated an area-weighted relative abundance index by multiplying predicted biomass density by grid cell area, summing these values across all grid cells, and applying a standard bias correction \citep{thorson_geostatistical_2015, thorsonImplementingGeneric2016}.

\textbf{Comparing realized shifts with thermal envelopes shifts.}
To estimate population-specific shifts under climate-driven thermal change, we fitted species distribution models using temperature predictors. These models followed the structure described in \textit{\nameref{sec:Species spatiotemporal modeling}}, but excluded spatiotemporal random fields to focus on direct temperature effects. As predictors, we used (i) the average bottom temperature over the 12 months preceding the earliest survey month in a region, and (ii) the maximum bottom temperature of the previous year. The latter was included to reflect the hypothesis that temperature extremes, rather than means, are more likely to limit species’ ranges \citep{sunday_thermal_2019}. We then derived spatial metrics (range centroid and depth niche) as in \textit{\nameref{sec:Derivation of multi-dimensional distributional metrics and abundance.}}.These temperature-only models provide climate envelope-based expectations under thermal forcing.

\subsection{Bayesian trend analysis}\label{sec:Bayesian trend analysis}

We estimated trends in the set of spatial and thermal metrics described above using multivariate Bayesian mixed-effects models because these metrics are often correlated. For example, depth shifts can co-occur with changes in range centroid, and we modeled them jointly to capture shared variation. We initially modelled the outcomes using a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution, but posterior predictive checks revealed heavier tails than the MVN could capture, so we refitted the model using univariate Student-t distribution for each response, which are more robust to extreme values \citep[e.g.,][]{anderson_black-swan_2017}. Residual correlations across responses were retained using a multivariate normal correlation structure. This change improved predictive accuracy, as confirmed by higher leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores \citep{vehtari_practical_2017} (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:elpd}).

Next, we compared two alternative random-effects structures using LOO cross-validation: (i) random slopes varying by species–region combinations, and (ii) a hierarchicalstructure with species nested within regions. The nested specification was better supported and was therefore adopted for all subsequent analyses (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:elpd}). This hierarchical framework improved model fit and, importantly, allowed us to estimate global, regional, and species-level trends within a single unified model.




To improve interpretability and aid in model convergence, we mean-centered both the response variables and the time predictor within each species–region combination so that their mean is zero. As a result, the intercept can be omitted. We then rescaled time to decades, so that the slope can be interpreted directly as the rate of change per decade.
Thus the model can be written as:

\begin{align}
y_{i}^{(j)} &\sim \operatorname{Student-t}\left(\nu^{(j)}, \mu_{i}^{(j)}, \sqrt{\left(\sigma^{(j)}\right)^{2} + \left(s^{(j)}_{i}\right)^{2}}\right),\qquad j=1,\dots,4,\\
\mu_{i}^{(j)} &= \beta^{(j)} \cdot \text{decade}_{i} + \beta_{\text{region}[r[i]]}^{(j)} \cdot \text{decade}_{i} + \beta_{\text{species}[s[i]]}^{(j)} \cdot \text{decade}_{i},\label{eq:linearpred} \\
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1^2 & \rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2 & \rho_{13}\sigma_1\sigma_3 & \rho_{14}\sigma_1\sigma_4 \\

\noindent Here, $y^{(j)}_i$ denotes the response variable $j$ for observation $i$, where $j$ is the latitudinal centroid,
longitudinal centroid, depth niche or thermal niche (Table \ref{table:derived_quantities}). The linear predictor (Eq \ref{eq:linearpred}) includes a global slope of decade for response $j$, denoted $\beta^{(j)}$, along with a deviation in slope for region $r$, $\beta^{(j)}_{\text{region}[r[i]]}$, and a deviation in slope for species $s$ within region, $\beta^{(j)}_{\text{species}[s[i]]}$. Finally,
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ represents the residual covariance matrix capturing residual correlations among the response variables. The scale parameters $\sigma^{(j)}$ are estimated as part of the Student-t and the residual correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ controls how residuals co-vary across responses.

Throughout the following, Normal$(\mu,\sigma)$ and Student-t$(\nu,\mu,\sigma)$ denote distributions with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. We used weakly informative priors for the global slopes (decade effects), guided by published rates of range shifts, depth changes, and ocean warming. For latitudinal and longitudinal centroids, we specified Normal$(0, 50)$ km decade$^{-1}$ priors, which accommodate range shifts up to ~30 km decade$^{-1}$ observed in marine taxa \citep{poloczanska_global_2013}. For depth, we used a Normal$(0, 5)$ m decade$^{-1}$ prior, consistent with estimates of ~3.6 m decade$^{-1}$ deepening in North Sea demersal fish \citep{dulvy_climate_2008}. For thermal niches, we applied a Normal$(0, 0.5)$ $^\circ$C decade$^{-1}$ prior, encompassing values comparable to the ~0.37 $^\circ$C decade$^{-1}$ observed in rapidly warming shelf seas \citep{chen_longterm_2020}.
For group-level variation in slopes (the standard deviation of year effects), we used $\operatorname{Student-t}$ distributions truncated to $(0,\infty)$ with 3 degrees of freedom, allowing a wide range of biologically plausible variation. Priors were $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 30)$ km decade$^{-1}$ for spatial centroids, $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 10)$ m decade$^{-1}$ for depth, and $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 0.2)$ $^\circ$C decade$^{-1}$ for thermal niches. For species nested within regions, we specified slightly broader priors: $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 40)$ km decade$^{-1}$ for spatial centroids, $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 20)$ m decade$^{-1}$ for depth, and $\operatorname{Student-t}(3, 0, 0.4)$ $^\circ$C decade$^{-1}$ for thermal niches. These priors were validated against empirical distributions from the data to ensure consistency with observed variability (Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:priors}).

We fit models in R using the \texttt{brms} package \citep{burkner_brms_2017}, which interfaces with Stan via \texttt{rstan} \citep{stan2024,stan_development_team_rstan_2024}. All other priors followed \texttt{brms} defaults. Each model ran with four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of 4,000 iterations, discarding the first 2,000 as warm-up. The remaining 2,000 samples per chain (8,000 total post–warm-up draws) formed the posterior distribution. Convergence was confirmed by $\hat{R} < 1.01$, absence of divergent transitions, and effective sample sizes $>$ 400 for all key parameters \citep{vehtari_rank-normalization_2021}.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Discussion}

Marine biodiversity is undergoing rapid reorganization under ocean warming, with many studies documenting poleward and deepward range shifts as species track their thermal niches \citep{parmesan_globally_2003, perry_climate_2005, dulvy_climate_2008}. However, these latitudinal and vertical redistributions capture only a subset of possible responses and are typically examined in isolation \citep{fredston_reimagining_2025}. This one-dimensional perspective constrains our understanding of how species respond across the full suite of ecological pathways available to them—and whether such movements effectively reduce thermal exposure. To address this gap, we developed a multidimensional framework that jointly quantifies horizontal, vertical, and thermal niche trends for over 200 bottom-dwelling fish populations in 11 continental shelf regions spanning different level of warming. Our results show that redistributions are highly variable, weakly coordinated, and often ineffective at buffering populations from warming but with exceptions.

Many global syntheses have reported net poleward migration---typically on the order of tens of kilometers per decade---but our findings differ substantially. For example, Poloczanska et al. \cite{poloczanska_global_2013} estimated mean poleward shifts of 72.0 $\pm$ 13.5 km decade$^{-1}$ at species’ leading edges and 30.6 $\pm$  5.2 km decade$^{-1}$ for centroids, while Lenoir et al. \cite{lenoir_species_2020} reported comparable rates of 59.2 $\pm$ 9.4 km decade$^{-1}$ in the BioShifts database. In contrast, our median latitudinal shift of \LatMedian{} km decade$^{-1}$ \LatCI{} was one to two orders of magnitude smaller, with northward and southward movements largely balancing out across species and regions. Similar to \citep{rubenstein_climate_2023} we also found little evidence for a consistent deepward redistribution across regions, with a median depth shift of \DepthMedian{} m decade$^{-1}$ (\DepthCI). These results indicate that no single axis of movement dominates marine redistribution, contradicting expectations of uniform poleward or downward tracking.

The absence of coherent shifts does not imply a lack of biological response. Rather, it reflects how physical and biological processes jointly shape redistribution pathways. At broad scales, temperature declines predictably with latitude and depth, but local climate velocities, bathymetric barriers, currents, hypoxia, and habitat structure generate complex mosaics of thermal opportunity (e.g., \citep{pinsky_marine_2013, garcia_molinos_climate_2016}). Species traits, dispersal limits, habitat dependence, and non-thermal factors---such as fishing, oxygen or prey availability---further modulate responses, often decoupling movement from simple thermal tracking \citep{sunday_species_2015,deutsch_climate_2015,wisz_role_2013,van_der_putten_predicting_2010}. These interacting constraints produce heterogeneous, sometimes opposing, shifts---even among co-occurring species.

These physical and biological constraints help explain why redistributions only weakly tracked expected thermal-envelope shifts. Roughly half of populations moved in the direction predicted by local warming, while the remainder shifted oppositely or exhibited little movement. In many cases, the magnitude of observed shifts exceeded that of thermal gradients, suggesting that dispersal ability is not the key limiting factor. Yet despite these shifts, most populations continued to warm roughly in step with regional warming trends. The resulting mismatch between redistribution and thermal niche change indicates that redistribution rarely provides full thermal compensation. Marine species appear to occupy dynamic thermal niches to some extent, rather than simply tracking static isotherms \citep{fredston_range_2021, ward_win_2024}. This partial compensation suggests that behavioral or distributional responses may not be sufficient to buffer many populations from continued warming, potentially increasing their exposure to thermal stress. % some citation about lagging behind I guess

Not all regions or species deviate from expected redistribution patterns. In the Eastern Bering Sea, for example, 88\% of species shifted in the thermally predicted latitudinal direction, with three times more species moving north than south. On the U.S. West Coast and in British Columbia, vertical movements dominated, consistent with depth-temperature gradients. The North Sea stands out as a case of highly coherent adjustment \cite{perry_climate_2005}: more than 60\% of species shifted in predicted directions along latitude, depth, and longitude, with correlations exceeding $\rho > 0.8$. At the species level, North Sea cod (\textit{Gadus morhua})---a well studied example \citep{perry_climate_2005, engelhard_climate_2014}---shifted simultaneously northward and deeper, effectively tracking its thermal niche. These cases illustrate that coherent thermal tracking can occur, but it is not the norm across marine systems.

Partial thermal compensation emerged within several regions through movements along the locally dominant environmental gradients. Where strong latitudinal gradients existed---such as in the Eastern Bering Sea, NEUS–SS, and parts of the North Sea---poleward movements reduced thermal exposure. In regions with limited latitudinal gradient, such as the Gulf of Mexico, compensation instead relied on depth. Depth also became the effective axis where horizontal and vertical gradients were tightly coupled, as in much of the North Sea, or where steep vertical gradients were available, as in British Columbia.

Many cross-regional analyses pool data from heterogeneous sources and methodologies and typically lack uncertainty estimates for underlying shifts \citep{brown_ecological_2016, lenoir_species_2020, dahms_temperature_2023}. Our two-step modeling framework addresses these limitations within a unified statistical structure. First, we fitted spatiotemporal models directly to raw survey data to estimate distributional metrics and their uncertainties while accounting for uneven sampling effort and methodological changes over time \citep{thorson_model-based_2016}. Second, we modeled temporal trends in these metrics within a Bayesian framework that propagated uncertainty consistently from the observation process to species-, regional-, and cross-regional summaries. This approach reduces methodological inconsistency and enables formal cross-system comparisons. The trade-off is reduced taxonomic and geographic coverage, as analyses were necessarily limited to well-sampled species in standardized surveys. These methodological differences likely contribute to the smaller and more heterogeneous shift rates we report compared with earlier cross-regional syntheses \citep{poloczanska_global_2013, lenoir_species_2020}. % also something about the fact that is multidimensional!!!

Taken together, our results show that marine redistributions are highly heterogeneous, weakly coordinated, and only partially aligned with thermal change. The limited cross-regional coherence underscores that range shifts are context-dependent processes shaped by the interplay of environmental gradients, species traits, habitat structure, and ecological interactions. This complexity challenges the simplistic assumption that species universally track cooler habitats along predictable gradients and highlights the need for multidimensional approaches to forecast biodiversity responses under ocean warming.


%Together, our findings reveal that marine redistributions under warming are not globally coherent adjustments along single axes but multidimensional, context-dependent responses shaped by local physical constraints and species-specific ecological pathways. While some populations track warming effectively, many show limited or misaligned shifts, resulting in persistent thermal exposure. These patterns suggest fundamental limits to distributional adaptation under continued ocean warming and highlight the need for climate-ready management strategies that account for regional complexity, response diversity, and the limited buffering capacity of redistribution.



%hiearachical scale with global, regional and species tithin regions allowed us to tease apart  broad- and fine-scale patterns and to address common sources of  error in studying range shifts (Brown et al., 2016). For example, measuring edge shifts only using latitude and not using our alongshore  distance metric might have masked some range shifts that occurred  in sections of the coast that slant eastward. We avoided some of the most common sources of  methodological error in detecting range shifts using a long timeseries, focusing on abundant species, and calculating edge position  as a percentile rather than from the most extreme values (Bates  et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2016). However, the high degree of variability that we observed in species’ range edge dynamics may be  as much or more due to imperfect sampling than to actual fluctuations in the species range.




%These within-region correlations show that, although global coherence is weak, local movements can still mitigate warming exposure along available thermal pathways.

%As a result, population-level range shifts are mediated by a combination of environmental, ecological, and physiological constraints, producing diverse redistribution pathways rather than uniform, directional movements.

%This weak cross-regional signal suggests that, although temperature declines with latitude and depth at broad scales, regional climate velocities form a complex mosaic that does not necessarily align range shifts along poleward or deepward axes . Collectively, these findings challenge the prevailing expectation that marine species consistently move poleward or deeper to maintain thermal affinity. Instead, they reveal a diversity of redistribution pathways and underscore the limits of assuming uniform, climate-driven tracking of cooler habitats. Such heterogeneity highlights that range shifts are context-dependent responses shaped by regional oceanography, species’ life histories, and ecological constraints.

%Final sentence


%This weak cross-regional signal may reflect that, while temperature generally declines with latitude and depth at broad scales, local climate velocities form a complex mosaic in which the directions of range shifts are not necessarily aligned poleward or deepward .
%Taken together, these results reinforce that poleward and deepward responses are neither as widespread nor as coherent as often presumed. Given this, we argue against the common expectation that species consistently move poleward or deeper to maintain thermal affinity. Instead, our findings highlight the diversity of redistribution strategies and the limits of simple assumptions that species universally track cooler habitats along predictable gradients. Such heterogeneity underscores the need to view range shifts not as uniform climate-driven migrations, but as context-dependent processes shaped by regional oceanography, life-history traits, and ecological constraints.




%Although some species and communities deepening, these responses were inconsistent overall. This pattern aligns with global syntheses showing similarly limited vertical movement. For instance, \citep{rubenstein_climate_2023} reported no systematic tendency for marine species to shift deeper in their meta-analysis of 315 studies spanning over 12,000 taxa. Such weak and variable depth responses contrast with the theoretical expectation that species should move downward to buffer against surface warming \citep{brown_effects_2015}. Depth-based redistribution therefore appears to be a secondary or constrained response, likely limited by habitat availability, oxygen gradients, and other ecological or physiological barriers.

Such heterogeneity underscores the need to view range shifts not as uniform climate-driven migrations, but as context-dependent processes shaped by regional oceanography, life-history traits, and ecological constraints.
%This overall lack of consistent poleward or deepward movement does not imply that all regions or species deviate from expectations. Some systems did exhibit coherent shifts consistent with thermal tracking. For example, in the Eastern Bering Sea, 64\% of species showed northward movement (compared to 21\% moving south), while in British Columbia 34\% shifted deeper and only 3\% shallower. Similarly, North Sea cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}) exhibited both northward and deepward shifts (xx and xxkm or mdecade$^{-1}$), a pattern increasingly well documented in the literature \citep{perry_climate_2005, engelhard_climate_2014}, tracking it's thermal niche (Fig x). 












%These complexities have important implications for predicting and managing biodiversity under climate change. Models that assume uniform poleward or deepward tracking are likely to overestimate species’ capacity to maintain suitable conditions. Incorporating multidimensional movement and exposure metrics, as done here, provides a more realistic view of how populations reorganize under warming. Such approaches can improve assessments of climate vulnerability and inform adaptive management strategies that account for spatial and thermal mismatches between species and their environments.

\section{Additional information on spatiotemporal models}\label{Appendix B}
    
The general form of the spatiotemporal GLMM can be represented as:
\begin{align}
    y_{s,t} &\sim \text{Tweedie} \left( \mu_{\boldsymbol{s},t}, p, \phi \right), \quad 1 < p < 2, \label{eq:1} \\
    \mu_{s,t} &= \exp \left( X_{\boldsymbol{s},t} \beta + \omega_{\boldsymbol{s}} + \epsilon_{\boldsymbol{s},t} \right), \label{eq:2} \\
    \omega &\sim \operatorname{MVN} \left(0, \Sigma_{\omega} \right), \label{eq:3} \\
    \epsilon_{t} &\sim \operatorname{MVN} \left(0, \Sigma_{\epsilon} \right), \label{eq:4}
\end{align}
where \( y_{\mathbf{s},t} \) represents fish density (kg/km\(^2\)) at spatial location \( \mathbf{s} \) and time \( t \), \( \mu \) is the expected mean CPUE, and \( p \) and \( \phi \) are the power and dispersion parameters of the Tweedie distribution, respectively. \( \mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{s},t} \) is the design matrix of covariates including year (as a categorical variable) and a second-degree polynomial of log(depth), consisting of both linear and quadratic terms. The vector \( \bm{\beta} \) contains the corresponding fixed-effect coefficients.
We included log-transformed depth as a second-order polynomial to help constrain predictions to plausible magnitudes across the depth gradient.

Because fish species are not constrained by survey boundaries, and some surveys cover only a small part of the distribution range of species we aggregated multiple surveys into broader regions for modeling when appropriate. Surveys with extensive and clearly defined coverage (e.g., the North Sea IBTS) were modeled independently, while those with contiguous spatial domains and partial overlap in time and space (i.e., surveys conducted in British Columbia, Northeast U.S \& Scotian Shelf and Celtic-Biscay shelf) were combined (Fig \ref{fig:survey}). For regions with multiple surveys, we included survey identity as a fixed effect to control for methodological differences. We did not apply this correction in British Columbia because surveys there follow harmonized field protocols and are typically analysed jointly \citep[e.g.,][]{Anderson2019BCGroundfish,ward_win_2024}. In regions where surveys occur multiple times per year (BAL, NS, NEUS-SS, CBS, GOM), we included quarter as a fixed effect to account for within-year variation in sampling. In cases where a designated sampling period extended across multiple quarters, we used combined categories (e.g., Q2–Q3 or Q3-Q4).

The parameters \( \omega_{\mathbf{s}} \) and \( \epsilon_{\mathbf{s},t} \) (Equations \ref{eq:3}--\ref{eq:4}) represent spatial and spatiotemporal random effects, respectively, both modeled as Gaussian Markov random fields \citep{lindgren_explicit_2011}. The spatial random field is shared across years, and represents static spatial effects such as habitat that are not accounted for by the fixed effects, while the spatiotemporal fields represent interannual spatial variation. We assumed spatiotemporal random fields to be independent across years to capture annual variation in spatial structure. While a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process could have been used to model temporal dependence, we opted for the independent formulation to strike a balance between computational efficiency and model flexibility. This approach allows spatial patterns to vary freely from year to year, accommodating potential non-stationary dynamics in species distributions without imposing strict temporal correlation structures.

For British Columbia surveys, which have a biennial sampling structure, we modeled spatiotemporal variation as a random walk process. This modifies Equation \ref{eq:4} into $\epsilon_{\boldsymbol{s},t} \sim  \operatorname{MVN}(\epsilon_{t-1},\Sigma_{\epsilon})$ to allow for flexibility in estimating the spatial and temporal processes in years without data \citep{ward_win_2024}.

Latent spatial and spatiotemporal random fields were approximated using a triangulated mesh with a minimum spacing (cutoff) of 20 km constructed with the \texttt{fmesher} R package \citep{lindgren_fmesher_2025}. This cutoff distance represents the smallest allowed distance between two mesh vertices. We assumed a shared range parameter (distance at which points are effectively independent \citep{lindgren_explicit_2011}) between the spatial and spatiotemporal fields, while allowing each field to have its own variance.

The maximum marginal log-likelihood was estimated using Template Model Builder \citep[TMB;][]{kristensen_tmb_2016}, which applies the Laplace approximation to integrate out random effects. Models were fit in R 4.1.0 \citep{r_core_team_r_2021} using the \texttt{sdmTMB} package \citep{anderson_sdmtmb_2024}, which interfaces TMB with INLA-based spatial methods \citep{rue_approximate_2009}. Only models with a positive-definite Hessian and a maximum absolute log-likelihood gradient $< 0.001$ were considered successfully converged and used for inference \citep{anderson_sdmtmb_2024}.

\section{Additional information on Bayesian trend analysis}\label{AppendixC}

For computing trends in latitudinal and longitudinal centroid, depht niche, and thermal niche we initially modelled the outcomes using a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution, but posterior predictive checks revealed heavier tails than the MVN could capture, so we refitted the model using univariate Student-t distribution for each response, which are more robust to extreme values \citep[e.g.,][]{anderson_black-swan_2017}. Residual correlations across responses were retained using a multivariate normal correlation structure. This change improved predictive accuracy, as confirmed by higher leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores (\citep{vehtari_practical_2017}; Table~\ref{tab:elpd_supp}).

An alternative to the hierarchical structure used here would have been to fit separate models for each species and outcome. But this ignores information shared across taxa, regions, and outcomes. Instead, a hierarchical specification applies partial pooling: estimates draw strength from the broader dataset while still allowing region- and species-specific deviations. This shrinkage produces estimates that are more stable than those from independent fits (Supplementary Fig.~\ref{fig:shrinkage_supp}; \citep{mcelreath_statistical_2018}), and, importantly, allowed us to estimate global, regional, and species-level trends within a single unified model.

\noindent
\textbf{Priors validation}.
We validated the priors listed in Table~\ref{tab:priors} by comparing them with empirical distributions estimated directly from the data. Specifically, for each outcome (latitude, longitude, depth, and temperature), we computed species-level linear trends and summarized the variation of these slopes across species and regions. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:priors_supp}, the chosen priors are consistent with the observed variability in the data.

\noindent
\textbf{Model diagnostics}.
Model fit and convergence were assessed using posterior predictive checks (PPCs) and standard MCMC diagnostics. PPCs confirmed that the model captures the central tendency, variability, and distributional shape of the observed data (Fig.~\ref{fig:pp_supp}). Convergence diagnostics indicated $\hat{R} < 1.01$ for all parameters, no divergent transitions, and effective sample sizes $> 400$, confirming reliable posterior sampling (Fig.~\ref{fig:rhat_supp}; \citep{vehtari_rank-normalization_2021}).
