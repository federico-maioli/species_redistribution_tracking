\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
The world's ocean are warming rapidly, driving a major reorganization of marine biodiversity \citep{ipcc_ocean_2019}. As temperature rise, species are expected to track their thermal niches ---the temperature ranges suitable for survival and reproduction \citep{grinnell_niche-relationships_1917}---through shifts in distribution. Widespread poleward and deepward movements have been documented across taxa and regions, suggesting one of the most pervasive and coherent biological responses to climate change \citep{parmesan_globally_2003, parmesan_ecological_2006, poloczanska_global_2013, poloczanska_responses_2016}. Still, many populations do not move as expected, with some remaining stationary or shifting the ``wrong way'' \citep{fuchs_wrong-way_2020,lawlor_mechanisms_2024}. Regardless of direction, such redistributions are reshaping marine ecosystems, altering food webs, challenging resource management, and redefining conservation priorities worldwide \citep{pinsky_preparing_2018, palacios-abrantes_climate_2025, pecl_biodiversity_2017}.

Despite extensive documentation of range shifts, most studies track shifts along a single gradient—typically latitude, or less often, depth \citep{nye_changing_2009, dulvy_climate_2008, pinsky_marine_2013}. Focusing on one gradient at a time oversimplifies species’ responses to warming and may help explain why our predictions of range shifts—both in magnitude and direction—often fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}, limiting our ability to anticipate future changes in species distributions and mitigate their impacts. In reality marine species do not respond to warming along one gradient alone. They can shift horizontally, move vertically into cooler waters, remain in place while tolerating increased thermal exposure, or exhibit a combination of these responses \citep{nye_changing_2009}. Considering shifts in multiple directions and their potential interactions offers a more realistic representation of climate-driven redistribution of marine fishes.

%% from here

%% h
To that end, we here develop and apply a multidimensional framework that considers three complementary dimensions of climate response: (i) horizontal range shifts, captured through changes in range centroids; (ii) vertical redistributions, reflected in realized depth niches; and
(iii) changes in realized thermal niches. This framework allows us to evaluate not only the direction and magnitude of spatial movements, but also whether such movements effectively track shifting thermal environments. If populations perfectly follow changing isotherms, their realized thermal niches should remain stable over time despite environmental warming. Conversely, systematic trends in thermal niche temperature would signal incomplete tracking and increasing thermal exposure.
Finally, to understand whether redistribution effectively buffers species from climate impacts, we link spatial and thermal adjustments to long-term abundance trends, testing whether movement strategies confer demographic resilience under ocean warming.
However, movement alone does not ensure persistence—species may shift yet continue to face warming, or remain stationary while maintaining stable populations. To determine whether redistribution effectively buffers species from climate impacts, we link spatial and thermal adjustments to long-term abundance trends, testing whether movement strategies confer demographic resilience under ocean warming.

Our study draws on a comprehensive set of standardized scientific bottom-trawl surveys, including more than 200 well sampled demersal (bottom-living) fish populations across 11 regions of the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. These regions include some of the fastest-warming continental shelf seas \citep{pershing_slow_2015, song_arctic_2023}, span broad latitudinal and climatic gradients, and contain some of the most comprehensive long-term records of marine biodiversity change \citep{maureaud_are_2021, maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}. Together, these contrasts in climate exposure and exceptional data coverage make these regions a natural laboratory for understanding how marine species respond to ocean warming.

We use spatiotemporal and Bayesian mixed-effects models to quantify long-term trends in species’ range centroids, depth distributions, and thermal niches. By examining patterns both within and across regions, we identify common strategies of climate response and assess which are most effective at reducing thermal exposure. Finally, we link these strategies to long-term abundance trends to evaluate whether species that better track changing conditions maintain more stable populations.
%Finally, we test whether these strategies are associated with changes in population abundance, potentially distinguishing species that are adapting to warming conditions from those in decline.



%These regions include some of the fastest-warming continental shelf seas \citep{pershing_slow_2015, song_arctic_2023}, span broad latitudinal and climatic gradients, and provide some of the world's most comprehensive long-term records of marine biodiversity change \citep{maureaud_are_2021, maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}. 



%Continental shelfs sustain exceptional biodiversity and productivity, support some of the world’s largest fisheries, and contribute roughly X\% of the global marine catch \citep{watson_database_2017}. Shelf systems also experience warming at rates exceeding the global ocean average , exposing resident species to accelerated thermal stress. Thus, continental shelves support high biodiversity and productivity while facing disproportionate exposure to climate-driven warming.

 
 


%or We hypothesize that if populations perfectly track shifting temperatures, their realized thermal niches should remain stable through time despite environmental warming.

%By linking these spatial and thermal responses to long-term abundance trends, we test whether movement can buffer populations and sustain demographic resilience under climate change.

%%%% Second part

%Embracing this multidimensional perspective marks an essential step toward improving our ability to monitor, model, and manage species on the move.



%However,  Considering shifts in multiple directions and their potential interactions offers a more realistic representation of climate-driven redistribution of marine fishes. If populations perfectly track temperature, their niche should remain stable over time despite enviornmetnal warmig. In contrast, tredns in termal nich temperature would signal incomplete tracking. 


%Critically, these two missing pieces—considering multidimensional redistribution and linking shifts to demographic outcomes—are essential for understanding how populations cope with warming and whether movements effectively buffer species from thermal stress. 


%A further uncertainty is whether these redistributions actually mitigate thermal stress or translate into demographic benefits. Movement alone does not guarantee persistence under climate change—species may shift yet still experience warming, or remain stationary while maintaining stable populations. Understanding how spatial and thermal adjustments interact, and whether they confer resilience or risk, requires a multidimensional perspective that links redistribution to exposure and abundance outcomes.

% or remaining in place while tolerating or adapting to thermal change. It is also unclear wether movements or lack thereof help them persist under warming. 

 % this is also nice
%Despite the ubiquity of observed shifts, predictions of their direction and magnitude frequently fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}. One key reason is that most studies track redistribution along a single gradient—typically latitude, or less commonly, depth \citep{pinsky_marine_2013, dulvy_climate_2008}. This unidimensional focus overlooks how species respond simultaneously along multiple, interacting axes. In reality, marine populations can shift horizontally, redistribute vertically into cooler waters, or remain in place while tolerating increased thermal exposure \citep{nye_changing_2009}. Such multidimensional responses complicate how we interpret redistribution and may help explain persistent model mismatches between predicted and observed shifts.

%Evaluating these multidimensional responses together is essential to understand not only how species redistribute, but whether such movements effectively buffer populations from demographic decline.


%Our analysis combines these redistribution metrics with long-term trends in population abundance, providing a rare opportunity to link spatial and demographic responses to climate change. Drawing on standardized bottom-trawl surveys for more than 200 demersal fish populations across 11 continental shelf regions of the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific—among the fastest-warming marine ecosystems globally—we use spatiotemporal and Bayesian mixed-effects models to quantify shifts in range, depth, and temperature niches. We then identify whether distinct combinations of responses form coherent redistribution strategies and evaluate whether these strategies are associated with population growth or decline, thereby testing whether movement confers demographic resilience under ocean warming.

%Species are on the move in response to rapidly warming oceans, with many expected to shift poleward or into deeper waters to track their thermal niches—the ranges of temperatures suitable for survival and reproduction \citep{grinnell_niche-relationships_1917, poloczanska_global_2013}. Yet predictions of the direction and magnitude of these shifts often fall short \citep{lawlor_mechanisms_2024, fredston_reimagining_2025}, limiting our ability to anticipate changes in species distributions and to design effective management and conservation strategies. One key reason for this shortfall is that most studies examine redistribution along a single axis, such as latitude or depth \citep{pinsky_marine_2013, dulvy_climate_2008}. In reality, marine species can respond along multiple dimensions simultaneously: . Critically, understanding both the multidimensional nature of redistribution and whether such movements confer demographic benefits is essential for assessing how species cope with ocean warming.

\section{Equations}\label{sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX\ can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (``display equations''). For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. E.g.: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or align environments:
\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use \verb+\footnotetext[]{...}+ tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). 
For the corresponding footnotemark use \verb+\footnotemark[...]+

\begin{table}[h]

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable*}+.

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX\ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for \verb+PDFLaTeX+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+LaTeX/PDFLaTeX+ is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

%%=============================================%%

\end{figure}

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \verb+\begin{figure*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure*}+.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. 

\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

Packages \verb+algorithm+, \verb+algorithmicx+ and \verb+algpseudocode+ are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX\ using the format:

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment. For program codes, the ``verbatim'' package is required and the command to be used is \verb+\begin{verbatim}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{verbatim}+. 

Similarly, for \verb+listings+, use the \verb+listings+ package. \verb+\begin{lstlisting}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{lstlisting}+ is used to set environments similar to \verb+verbatim+ environment. Refer to the \verb+lstlisting+ package documentation for more details.

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command. You can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure~\ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command 
\verb+Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}''. 

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is \verb+\label{algln2}+. To cross-reference it, use the command \verb+\ref{algln2}+ for which it comes up as line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec7}

Standard \LaTeX\ permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses \verb+natbib+ \LaTeX\ package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for \verb+\cite{...}+: \cite{bib1}. Another example for \verb+\citep{...}+: \citep{bib2}. For author-year citation mode, \verb+\cite{...}+ prints Jones et al. (1990) and \verb+\citep{...}+ prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: \cite{bib3}, \cite{bib4}, \cite{bib5}, \cite{bib6}, \cite{bib7}, \cite{bib8}, \cite{bib9}, \cite{bib10}, \cite{bib11}, \cite{bib12} and \cite{bib13}.

\section{Examples for theorem like environments}\label{sec10}

For theorem like environments, we require \verb+amsthm+ package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists---\verb+thmstyleone+, \verb+thmstyletwo+ and \verb+thmstylethree+

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Data sources}

\subsubsection{Fish observations}
Fish density data (kg/km\textsuperscript{2}) were obtained from 
a large-scale compilation of standardized, fishery-independent bottom-trawl surveys \citep{maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}. Each trawl deployment (haul) records the catch by species, with biomass standardized by the sampled (``swept'') area, alongside the haul’s location, depth, and time. We selected surveys with a consistent sampling protocol and temporal coverage of at least 15 years \citep{maureaud_fishglob_data_2024}, resulting in 17 surveys across 11 regions (Fig \ref{fig:map}).

\subsubsection{Temperature data}
Since most observations lack in situ measurements of bottom temperature, we used monthly bottom temperature data derived from the Copernicus Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis \citep{european_union-copernicus_marine_service_global_2018}, which provides values on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 1/12$^{\circ}$ (approximately 7 km at the study latitudes).


\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
