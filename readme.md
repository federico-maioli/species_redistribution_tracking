# Repository structure

 - `R/`
Contains all R scripts used for the data analysis. This folder includes code for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and generating outputs.

 - `tex/`
Contains the LaTeX files used for writing the manuscript. This includes the main text, sections, references, and any formatting needed for the final document.

 - `renv/`
Used to manage the project’s R environment. This ensures reproducibility by specifying the exact package versions used in the analysis. You shouldn't care about this.

 - `output/`
Contains all figures, tables, and numerical results produced by the analysis and reported in the text. This folder serves as the central location for outputs referenced in the manuscript.
